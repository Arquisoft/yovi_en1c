== Architecture Constraints


ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Any requirement that constraints software architects in their freedom of design and implementation decisions or decision about the development process. These constraints sometimes go beyond individual systems and are valid for whole organizations and companies.

.Motivation
Architects should know exactly where they are free in their design decisions and where they must adhere to constraints.
Constraints must always be dealt with; they may be negotiable, though.

.Form
Simple tables of constraints with explanations.
If needed you can subdivide them into
technical constraints, organizational and political constraints and
conventions (e.g. programming or versioning guidelines, documentation or naming conventions)


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-2/[Architecture Constraints] in the arc42 documentation.

=== Technical Constraints

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Technical constraints that restrict architectural and implementation decisions.

.Motivation
These constraints shape the fundamental design of the system and affect technology choices.

|===
| Constraint ID | Constraint | Impact | Rationale

| TC-01
| **Microservices Architecture**
| System must be deployed as three independent containerized services (Webapp, Users Service, GameY)
| University ASW labs require practice with distributed system architecture and Docker-based deployments

| TC-02
| **Programming Language Diversity**
| Frontend must use TypeScript/React, Backend must use Node.js/Express, Game engine must use Rust
| Learning objectives require hands-on experience with multiple programming paradigms and ecosystems

| TC-03
| **Docker Containerization**
| All services must be containerized and orchestrated via Docker Compose
| Standardized deployment environment across development, testing, and production

| TC-04
| **HTTP/REST API Communication**
| All inter-service communication must use HTTP REST protocol with JSON data format
| Industry standard for microservices communication; ensures compatibility and simplicity

| TC-05
| **Real-time Game Updates**
| Game engine must support WebSocket connections for real-time player interactions
| User experience requirement for responsive gaming; avoids polling overhead

| TC-06
| **Monitoring Stack Integration**
| All services must expose Prometheus metrics; system must include Prometheus and Grafana stack
| Production observability requirement; enables performance monitoring and alerting

| TC-07
| **Git Repository Structure**
| All code must be maintained in a single monorepo with multi-component structure
| Facilitates coordinated development across multiple teams and services

=== Organizational Constraints

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Organizational constraints and political constraints that influence architectural decisions.

.Motivation
Understanding organizational constraints is essential for realistic and feasible architecture decisions.

|===
| Constraint ID | Constraint | Impact | Rationale

| OC-01
| **Academic Project**
| Project follows ASW (Advanced Software Architecture) laboratory curriculum
| Learning outcomes take precedence; project serves educational purposes

| OC-02
| **Team-Based Development**
| Multiple team members work on different components simultaneously
| Requires clear separation of concerns and well-defined interfaces between services

| OC-03
| **GitHub Repository**
| Code must be hosted on GitHub under Arquisoft organization (arquisoft/yovi_0)
| Version control, CI/CD integration, and artifact publication requirements

| OC-04
| **SonarCloud Quality Gates**
| Code must pass SonarCloud quality analysis and coverage thresholds
| Quality assurance and maintainability requirements

| OC-05
| **Release and Deployment Automation**
| Automated CI/CD pipelines must build, test, and deploy on every release
| Ensures consistency and reduces manual deployment errors

=== Conventions and Naming Guidelines

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Programming, documentation and naming conventions that should be adhered to by all team members.

.Motivation
Conventions improve consistency, readability and maintainability of the codebase and documentation.
****
endif::arc42help[]

|===
| Convention | Rules | Example

| **Project Structure**
| Each service in separate directory; services are independently deployable
| `/webapp`, `/users`, `/gamey`, `/docs`

| **Package Naming**
| Services follow npm/Cargo naming conventions; lowercase with hyphens where appropriate
| `yovi_0-webapp`, `yovi_0-users`, `gamey`

| **API Endpoints**
| REST endpoints follow RESTful conventions; resource-based paths
| `POST /createuser`, `GET /game/:id`, `POST /move`

| **Configuration**
| Environment-specific settings via environment variables and `.env` files
| `VITE_API_URL`, service ports, database URLs

| **Documentation**
| Arc42 template in AsciiDoc format; architecture documentation in `/docs/src`
| `01_introduction.adoc`, `03_context_and_scope.adoc`

| **Testing**
| Unit tests co-located with source code; test files suffixed with `.test.ts/.test.js`
| `RegisterForm.test.tsx`, `users-service.test.js`

| **Code Quality**
| TypeScript strict mode; ESLint configuration; Rust clippy lints
| All code must pass linting before CI/CD acceptance
