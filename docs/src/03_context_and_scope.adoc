== Context and Scope


ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Context and scope - as the name suggests - delimits your system (i.e. your scope) from all its communication partners
(neighboring systems and users, i.e. the context of your system). It thereby specifies the external interfaces.

If necessary, differentiate the business context (domain specific inputs and outputs) from the technical context (channels, protocols, hardware).

.Motivation
The domain interfaces and technical interfaces to communication partners are among your system's most critical aspects. Make sure that you completely understand them.

.Form
Various options:

* Context diagrams
* Lists of communication partners and their interfaces.


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-3/[Context and Scope] in the arc42 documentation.

=== Business Context

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Specification of *all* communication partners (users, IT-systems, ...) with explanations of domain specific inputs and outputs or interfaces.
Optionally you can add domain specific formats or communication protocols.

.Motivation
All stakeholders should understand which data are exchanged with the environment of the system.

.Form
All kinds of diagrams that show the system as a black box and specify the domain interfaces to communication partners.

Alternatively (or additionally) you can use a table.
The title of the table is the name of your system, the three columns contain the name of the communication partner, the inputs, and the outputs.

.YOVI Communication Partners

|===
| Communication Partner | Inputs | Outputs

| End User (Browser)
| User registration data (name, credentials)
| HTML/CSS/JavaScript web interface, game board rendering

| Game Player
| Game moves, game commands (create game, choose piece, etc.)
| Game state, board updates, move validation responses

| External Bots/AI Players
| Game state queries, available moves requests
| Bot moves, strategic decisions

| System Administrators
| Configuration parameters, monitoring queries
| System health status, performance metrics, logs
|===

**Domain Interfaces Explanation:**

* **User Management Interface**: Users interact with the system through the web application to create accounts and manage their profiles.
* **Game Interface**: The core business logic revolves around game creation, move validation, and game state management (pieces, coordinates, players).
* **Bot Interface**: The system supports bot players that communicate with the game engine to perform moves and participate in games.
* **Monitoring Interface**: System health and performance data is exposed for operational monitoring.

=== Technical Context

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Technical interfaces (channels and transmission media) linking your system to its environment. In addition a mapping of domain specific input/output to the channels, i.e. an explanation which I/O uses which channel.

.Motivation
Many stakeholders make architectural decision based on the technical interfaces between the system and its context. Especially infrastructure or hardware designers decide these technical interfaces.

.Form
E.g. UML deployment diagram describing channels to neighboring systems,
together with a mapping table showing the relationships between channels and input/output.

.Technical Components and Communication Channels

|===
| Component | Protocol | Port | Technology | Purpose

| Webapp (Frontend)
| HTTP/HTTPS
| 80, 443
| React, TypeScript, Vite
| Web user interface

| Users Service
| HTTP/REST
| 3000
| Node.js, Express
| User management and registration

| GameY Engine
| HTTP/REST, WebSocket
| 4000
| Rust, Axum
| Game logic and bot registry

| Monitoring (Prometheus)
| HTTP
| 9090
| Prometheus
| Metrics collection

| Monitoring (Grafana)
| HTTP
| 9091
| Grafana
| Metrics visualization
|===

**Technical Interfaces:**

The system uses standard web protocols for communication:

* **HTTP/REST API**: Primary interface for synchronous communication between services and browser clients
* **WebSocket**: Real-time bidirectional communication for game interactions
* **JSON**: Data format for all API requests and responses
* **Prometheus Metrics**: Time-series metrics collection for system observability

**Mapping of Business I/O to Channels:**

* User registration data → HTTP POST /createuser endpoint (Users Service)
* Game moves and state → HTTP REST or WebSocket (GameY Engine)
* System metrics → Prometheus endpoints on each service
* Monitoring dashboards → Grafana HTTP interface
