== Solution Strategy

4.1 Technological decisions
Here are the key decisions related to the technological aspects of our project. Reasons behind these decisions are described briefly for each solution.

[cols="1,2" options="header"]
|===
| **Name** | **Motivation**
| Rust | An in-demand programming language in the industry and renowned for its performance.Our professors have set this as a so-called constraint. 
| TypeScript | Better performance and error catching capabilities than its subset JavaScript. Works seamlessly with HTML and CSS.
| MongoDB | Flexible data storage model fits our project than its relational counterparts.
| React | Widely used JavaScript framework facilitates user-friendly components for the front-end.
| Vite | Complements React UI library. Modern industry standard for React projects.
| Express | Facilitates easy HTTP req/res cycle for the back end of the user creation page.
| Docker | We can encapsulate different components of our software application into Docker containers which can be hosted on Azure.
| Azure | Offers an on-demand computing environment over the cloud for our virtual machine that is highly scalable.
| Github | Easier code management via Git version control. Automatic code deployment to the virtual machine via GitHub Actions.

4.2 Achieving key quality goals
* **Maintainability:** Well structured code along with proper documentation that guides developers to maintain the application
* **Usability:** Rust provides high-quality performance. UI will be designed to be as intuitive as possible for the game users with React.
* **Availability:** We are looking to deploy multiple server instances to create redundancy and to avoid single points of failure.
